# TreeXplorer

### <ins>Problem Statement</ins>:- Decision trees are one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms due to their interpretability and effectiveness. However, many learners and practitioners struggle to understand how these models make predictions, how splits are formed, and how hyperparameters affect tree structure. Existing visualization tools are often static, complex to set up, or lack interactivity.

#### <ins>There is a need for a tool that can:</ins>
#### 1. Allow users to train and visualize decision trees in real-time with adjustable parameters.
#### 2. Demonstrate how algorithms like XGBoost build and optimize trees.
#### 3. Provide an interactive, web-based interface for both learning and experimentation.
#### 4. Help users understand the effect of features, splits, and depth on the final model.

#### <ins>Introducing TreeXplorer:-</ins>
#### 1. Build decision trees interactively using XGBoost and Scikit-learn.
#### 2. Visualize the tree structure with Graphviz for easy interpretation.
#### 3. Enable users to tune hyperparameters and immediately see the effect on the tree.
#### 4. Provide a user-friendly Streamlit app for exploration, experimentation, and learning.
